# TripleX

You, a Starship Captain, have been diverted off course in response to a destress signal. 
The signal has brought you and your crew aboard an abandoned alien vessel.

You must unlock the on-board computer terminal to access the ship's log and to find out what has happened.
The terminal is locked by a three-digit code. You are given the sum and product of the three-digit code.

**Sample Problem**

```
The code adds-up to: 3
The code multiplies to give: 1

Guess the three-digit code. Insert a space between each digit:
```
<details><summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```
  1 1 1
  ```
  
</details>

**Gameplay**

There are three levels to the terminal in where you must decipher the three-digit code. 
A word of caution, don't guess by compulsion. This is an unkown alien species, who knows what type of security measures they have in place should you guess wrong too many times.

**Thanks for playing the game! I hope you have fun!**

Special thanks to Udemy. The initialization for this game stems from the first assignment of the **Unreal Engine C++ Developer** course.
