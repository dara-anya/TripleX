# TripleX

You, a Starship Captain, have been diverted off course in response to a destress signal. 
The signal has brought you and your crew aboard an abandoned alien vessel.

You must unlock the on-board computer terminal to access the ship's log and to find out what has happened.
The terminal is locked by a three-digit code. You are given the sum and product of the three-digit code.

**Sample Problem**

```
The code adds-up to: 3
The code multiplies to give: 1
```

" beceause 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 and 1 * 1 * 1 = 1




'require "**scientists"'**
/* 
In this game there are three numbers in a code
The code multiplies to give --
The code adds-up to give --
The user must guess the three digit code
*/

```c++
const int require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
